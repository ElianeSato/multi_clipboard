# Welcome to Extended Updatable Multi-Clipboard
Project based on 'Updatable Multi-Clipboard' from the book 'Automate the Boring Stuff with Python' by Al Sweigart.
This Python program manages short messages used repetitively in emails answers and is running with the command line argument.
The message associated with a provided keyword will be copied to the clipboard to be pasted into an email.
In this project I added a *delete* keyword command line argument and a *delete all* command line argument to delete all keywords.
